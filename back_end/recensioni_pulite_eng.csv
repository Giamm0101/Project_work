A little disappointing,g1006504-d2320409, 28 marzo 2023,couples,"When we moved to the area in early 2020, one of our neighbours told us that Bentleys was his favourite places for a Sunday carvery.  Then came Covid and lockdowns, so that we have only now been able to try it out, since its reopening last month.  We were very much looking forward to it and, whilst it was OK, it was a little disappointing.

Firstly the complimentary hors d’oeuvres.  One small rectangular plate was presented to us, but whilst the quantity of what was on there was fine for two, the actual components on it were one chicken skewer, one spring roll and two small, but different, tarts, meaning that, other than the olives and feta, everything had to be cut in half to enable us each to sample everything!

The carvery itself was neither the best that I have ever had, but nor was it the worst.  I was impressed that the beef was cooked as beef should be, and not cremated, and commented as much to the chef. As this was unusual for a carvery both my wife and I went for it plus some turkey.  I have to say that the turkey was very nice, but the beef was rather chewy.  Vegetables were OK; I thought that the roast potatoes could have been a bit crispier and the Yorkshire was pretty rock solid.

For dessert, my wife chose the lemon meringue which, I think was a good choice, because I went for rhubarb crumble and custard and found the crumble topping to be almost as solid as a pie crust.

I'm afraid that it is unlikely that we will be rushing back.","Punteggio 3,0 su 5","",""

Some folks have left negative reviews on here without having taken any issue up with Margaret the owner. How can any business address an issue if you don’t tell them at the time. Maybe it’s just a lack of backbone or there wasn’t much of an issue in the first place.

The dogs all swishing their tails, scratching themselves,  drooling and trying to get food/attention etc - its quite disgusting. I own a food production company and operate in conjunction with Environmental Health, I fail to see why dogs are permitted en masse in a restaurant when they are completey banned in the food preparation area - what is the difference - hair and god knows what else is freely circulating in the restaurant and therefore potentially onto food, eating surfaces, equipment etc. Would it not be sensible to have a section dog-free? Which would also cater for those with allergies? I think you might be surprised at the uptake. I would also comment those restaurants locally who do not permit dogs at all seem to be doing just fine in terms of business. As an aside, dogs are not permitted in supermarkets and dog owners seem to be able to plan around this easily - it's just comes down to rules and educating dog owners accordingly.","Punteggio 3,0 su 5","",""

Goodbye and good riddance,g1006504-d6620815, 27 settembre 2023,friends,"Finally, and thank God, this awful dump has been finally shut down, putting the good people of Ferndown out of their misery.
Not just the worst Wetherspoons pub in this country, but quite possibly the worst pub in any country.
I’m normally positively disposed towards Wetherspoons.
I don’t ever think about them, but most of the time they are generally ok and some of the time they are amazing.
And while I would never ever go out of my way to get to one, I wouldn’t necessarily walk past one, either.
Apart from this one.
OK, you can’t fault the beer in any Wetherspoons, and that was also the case here.
The beer was always excellent and served properly.
That’s if you could get any of the bottom-of-the barrel staff to serve you.
Instead of serving customers the staff were more likely to be chatting in the corner, tapping away on their iPhones, adjusting their facial jewellery, comparing tattoos, in short doing ANYTHING except serving customers.
And when they could be bothered to serve customers, they’d wander out from their hiding hole yelling ‘who’s next?’.
They’d never know who was next.
I’d be surprised if they knew what day it was.
When I worked in pubs and nightclubs you’d be sacked if you, as a member of the bar staff, didn’t know who the next 5 to 8 customers were in the correct order.
You had to have that constantly changing list in your head.
You’d be sacked if you shouted ‘who’s next?’.
But not here; uselessness was the norm.
There were some odd members of staff who tried their best, but they were few and far between.
The food ranged from absolutely average at best, to utterly inedible at worst.
It was never above average.
Since when were chips that always seemed to have been ‘steamed’ a good idea?
And it was all dumped on the plate and then thrown down on the table, usually without some of the ingredients listed on the menu as part of the ‘dish’, and with other things that you had ordered and paid for also missing (‘uh, yuhh, we nevuh got any of that, duhhhhh…’).
Occasionally, the so-called bar staff would wear body cams, which always made everyone laugh.
The irony is that it should have been the customers wearing the body cams, just to record how dreadful most of the staff (but not all of them) were at their chosen profession.
The rumours are that the building will now be torn down and that apartments be will built on the site.
I’m tempted to buy one, not to live in it, but to occasionally use and flush the toilet in memory of this awful dump.
Property prices in Ferndown will probably go up in now that it is gone.
Not before time.

Grumpy Staff,g1006175-d6104159, 3 novembre 2023,family,"Visited the Castle Brew House for an evening meal with other family members. From the very start the experience was spoilt by a very miserable and grumpy barman. Everything seamed too much for him to do and he was very unwelcoming. Firstly I asked if we could have a tab and his reply was very abrupt stating they do not do tabs. I fully appreciate why but the curt response was uncalled for.

 Having ordered the drinks I asked if we paid for the food when we ordered it. The reply was again very curt with him telling me that 1 person should pay for all of the meals and collect the money off the others later! When we finally orders the food 1 of the group wanted skinny chips rather than fat cut. When I asked if they could change the chips the barman was very unhelpful and stated that if he changed the chips we would only have a small portion of skinny chips as they were a starter size. I would have expected him to have gladly substitute the chips, but no, that was too much trouble. How inflexible! 

The food we had was very enjoyable but the experience was spoiled by the attitude of a very grumpy barman. Everything appeared too much trouble for him.

Hidden gem with an excellent offering,g1005967-d13447953, 4 gennaio 2024,couples,"We live nearby and the two of us have been going regularly for the last few months. We have been in for an early breakfast, brunch at the weekend and often drop in to just pick something up to take home as a snack in the afternoons. Not only is the quality of what is on offer consistently great (amazing cakes and buns in particular!) it's also well-priced and the service is uniformly excellent. 

The Nutmeg Tree always provides a welcoming atmosphere and it's clear that it draws all sorts of people throughout the day, whether for a cup of tea and a scone, or something more substantial. Personally, we love it for brunch on a sunday when something more substantial might be needed to help recover from the night before...

A particular success was the recent experiment with a supper evening focused on charcuterie and cheese boards supplemented with some of the stalwarts like smaller version of the rather excellent sausage rolls. We bought the in-laws along and were happy to see a broad range of families, friends and couples there for the evening. All in all we thought this was a fantastic event and really hope there's more evenings like this throughout the year ahead!

I’m more disappointed as it was for my friend’s birthday and the experience was a shambles.

Needs to go on Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares! Worst curry house I've ever been to.,g1006504-d2178057, 12 agosto 2023,family,"As a family we decided to go try Ferndowns #5 restaurant... We walked in and asked if there was a table as we hadn't booked. After a minute of waiting we were told the table in the window was available for us. As soon as we had sat down a waiter asked if we'd like poppadoms to which having been put on the spot I just ordered 1 each for the family (3 of us). Had I have seen the price I'd have likely not bothered as I was billed for two lots of pickles... For three popadoms! 

That aside I had to ask three times to get a menu, the writing was on the wall at this point and should've paid for the poppadoms and left! We eventually ordered and despite the restaurant being moderately busy it took 55 minutes to get our meals. Mine and my sons were visibly not hot, I touched the bottom of the ceramic bowls the curry was served in and they were Luke warm at best, clearly had been sat waiting for the third main to be cooked and had not been under a heat lamp. If I was to guess the temperature I'd say they were 35-40°C which is certainly way below the hot holding temperature! I work in the food industry so can tell.

 I cut off a little piece of chicken from both of the COLD curry dishes to try and I can confirm that they were way too cold... 

I asked for these two meals to be recooked and the manager who had been brought over by the waiter which didn't speak English to see what we wanted... He offered to reheat these in the microwave which I said was unacceptable as these had been in the ""danger zone"" for an unknown period of time. He agreed to have them freshly cooked, five minutes later two replaced microwaved dinners returned. How can I tell? Because the two pieces of chicken I cut into were still present.

I then had to ask for cutlery and a plate... Having had to wait so long for such a disappointing meal was the icing on the cake, Completely lack lustre in flavour, also asked for the bhuna masala (their chicken tikka masala as a mild from their mild, medium or hot) and it turned up pretty spicy, considerably spicier than the hot curry I had ordered.

I would suggest this restaurant spends less time cutting fancy shapes out of onions and learns about hot holding temperatures, safety management systems and how to cook a decent BIR curry. A 1 star rating is too kind. I don't appreciate walking out of somewhere £80 lighter for potential food poisoning.

On a plus side the pint of Kingfisher was cold.

If the restaurant had been busy I would have understood, but there were other tables that had been there far longer than us.
We had all had two courses and had finished but were catching up and generally chatting. I would have argued but didn't want to upset the family members we were with.

I have this evening had a Charlie bighams fish pie from Tesco which was cheaper, double the size & depth, had loads of fish & tons of flavour. 
I appreciate pubs & restaurants are having to put up their prices & make servings smaller in order to still make money in the current financial climate but they must be careful to not go so far as to lose customers due to the poor quality of their meals because that also will put them out of business.","Punteggio 2,0 su 5","",""

Sausage and mash, fish and chips and sticky toffee pudding completed the meal.  All of them very good. Rosemary chips (from real potatoes!) were a great surprise.  Staff were very helpful and made a fuss of our small dog.  The only pity was that the two cask ales were not yet ready, (a definite 5 star otherwise) but on a dull Wednesday in November I can't imagine trade is too brisk. Plenty of other beers were available, including a coupe of non-alcoholic offerings.

It is truly awful.
The food is poor quality, overcooked and tastes of cardboard.
The service is dire. Absolutely no warmth or hospitality in a single bone of the servers bodies.  They just seemed to lack complete foresight to recognise items were running low/out and being proactive in making sure it was replenished.
Due to this most of the breakfast items weren’t regularly restocked so you had people waiting for pastries (we never tried any because they were always empty!) 
Coffee wasn’t refilled regularly and again, had to wait for this despite seeing fresh pots available on the staff side of the counter. 
It wasn’t busy so there really wasn’t any excuse for the lack of service. 
Glasses were also dirty which is pretty grim.

Worst roast I have had in years,g1005967-d2459574, 25 settembre 2022,none,"We visited today in a group of 6 and pre booked. When we arrived we went and got our own drinks as no one came over.

Eventually after 30 mins someone came and took our food order. We all ordered roast and two of us ordered the beef roast cooked rare. When the food arrived it looked sad. The roast potato's were not even roasted, more like boiled. The veg was also under cooked and there was barely any gravy.  The roast which I has asked to be cooked rare was more like well done. I did speak to the waiter about this but he seemed oblivious and nothing more was done. We were still charged for it even though I barely touched it and as you can see in the photo does not look appealing. During the meal a fly landed in my food twice, once getting stuck and I had to tear the Yorkshire pudding apart to get it out and also once landed in my glass of wine.
